# Eye-blinking-detection

Here I have used dlib and 68 face landmark package do detect the eyes in the image. The vertical and horizontal length of the eye is found using the eye lanmark points.
The ratio of horizontal and vertical length of eye is calculated. When blinking takes place the ratio decreases. Because of this the blinking of eye can be found.
